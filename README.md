#### ARA-CNN

This repository contains an implementation of ARA-CNN - a Bayesian deep learning model intended for histopathological 
image classification.

ARA stands for Accurate, Reliable and Active. Any method that works on patient data needs to be accurate and reliable, 
meaning that in addition to very high classification accuracy it should also provide a measure of uncertainty for each 
prediction. ARA-CNN adheres to these requirements. Moreover, the uncertainty measurement can be used as an acquisition 
function in active learning, which significantly speeds up the learning process on new histopathological datasets. 
Uncertainty can also be used to identify mislabelled training images.

##### Installation

Required dependencies: Python 3.6+

Installation process:

```
git clone https://github.com/animgoeth/ARA-CNN.git
cd ARA-CNN
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##### Dataset

Your dataset needs to have the following directory structure:

```
-+ dataset
--+ train
---+ class_0
---+ class_1
⋮
---+ class_N
--+ test
---+ class_0
---+ class_1
⋮
---+ class_N
```

Each `class_i` directory should contain image patches.

Modify `CLASS_DICT` in `src/config.py` to match your dataset's classes.

##### Example dataset

As a quick way to utilise ARA-CNN, you can download the *Kather et al.* colorectal cancer dataset. Execute the following:
```
cd dataset
python download_and_extract_crc_dataset.py
cd ..
```
This downloads the dataset, extracts it and prepares a correct directory structure.

##### Training

Execute the following command:

`python src/ara_cnn.py --output-path /your/output/path --dataset-path /your/dataset/path --epochs EPOCHS`

This command starts the training process on data in `/your/dataset/path/train`. After training, it performs inference 
on images in `/your/dataset/path/test` and writes all results to `/your/output/path/ara_cnn.txt` and the trained model 
to `/your/output/path/ara_cnn.h5`. The number of training epochs is set with the `--epochs` option.

`ara_cnn.txt` has the following format:

```
epoch_nr, loss, main_output_loss, aux_output_loss, main_output_acc, aux_output_acc, val_loss, val_main_output_loss, val_aux_output_loss, val_main_output_acc, val_aux_output_acc, eval_main_acc, eval_aux_acc
1, 2.064821, 1.992539, 1.831265, 0.398278, 0.324298, 4.835865, 4.972194, 2.721522, 0.196006, 0.137574, 0.906250, 0.893229
⋮
100, 0.481360, 0.392671, 0.464361, 0.867985, 0.844388, 0.359386, 0.278197, 0.274887, 0.909024, 0.897929, 0.906250, 0.893229
```

The columns in `ara_cnn.txt` are defined as such:
```
epoch_nr - training epoch number
loss - training set total loss
main_output_loss - training set loss returned by the main output
aux_output_loss - trainings set loss returned by the auxiliary output
main_output_acc - training set accuracy returned by the main output
aux_output_acc - training set accuracy returned by the auxiliary output
val_loss - validation set total loss
val_main_output_loss - validation set loss returned by the main output
val_aux_output_loss - validation set loss returned by the auxiliary output
val_main_output_acc - validation set accuracy returned by the main output
val_aux_output_acc - validation set accuracy returned by the auxiliary output
eval_main_acc - test set accuracy returned by the main output (note: this is measures after training is completed, so all rows contain the same value)
eval_aux_acc - test set accuracy returned by the auxiliary output (note: this is measures after training is completed, so all rows contain the same value)
```

##### Testing

Execute the following command:

`python src/test_model.py --input-images /your/input/images/path --model-path /your/model/path/ara_cnn.h5 --output-path /your/output/path --measure MEASURE`

All images in `/your/input/images/path` are tested and after that both the classification and uncertainty results are 
saved to `/your/output/path/results.csv`. The uncertainty is measured with the provided `MEASURE` - either `Entropy` 
or `BALD`.

`results.csv` has the following format:
```
image_name, uncertainty, class_0_probablity, ..., class_N_probability
img1.jpg, 0.1, 0.9, ..., 0.01
⋮
imgX.jpg, 0.9, 0.3, ..., 0.2
```

Note: In order to make the testing process work, you need to modify one of the Keras source files. 
In `venv/lib/python3.x/site-packages/keras/layers/advanced_activations.py` replace line 38 
`self.alpha = K.cast_to_floatx(alpha)` with the following code:

```
try:
    self.alpha = K.cast_to_floatx(alpha)
except TypeError:
    self.alpha = K.cast_to_floatx(alpha['value'])
```

##### Active learning and identification if mislabelled training samples

![ara_overview](http://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~lr370887/overview_figure_github.jpg)

As presented in the paper (see section **Paper** below), uncertainty can serve as an acquisition function in active learning.
By augmenting the training dataset with the most uncertain classes in subsequent active learning steps, the model can 
achieve high classification accuracy faster than with an acquisition function amounting to a random selection. Thus, 
when working with a pathologist, they should always try to annotate the most uncertain classes first.

On the other hand, the least uncertain images among misclassified patches from the training dataset can be identified as 
mislabelled and should be passed to a pathologist to re-annotate.

To find the most uncertain classes and least uncertain images, use this command:
`python src/process_results.py --results-file /your/output/path/results.csv --threshold T`

The file at `/your/output/path/results.csv` is loaded and processes, which results in a list of classes sorted by average 
uncertainty in descending order and a list of files with uncertainty below q(T).

Note that in order to identify mislabelled training samples, your `results.csv` file needs to contain the output from 
running inference on the training set and you'll need to find an intersection of the files returned by process_results.py 
and misclassified files from the training dataset.
